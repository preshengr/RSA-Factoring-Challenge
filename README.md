# RSA-Factoring-Challenge

## Overview

This repository, RSA-Factoring-Challenge, contains code related to RSA factoring challenges. The primary purpose is to factorize numbers in the context of RSA cryptography. The repository includes the following files:

1. **factors.c**
   - C source code file that provides functionality for factoring numbers.

2. **rsa**
   - Executable file or script related to RSA cryptography.

3. **test1**
   - Test file or example related to the RSA factoring challenge.

4. **wfactors.py**
   - Python script that may be related to factors or factoring in the RSA context.

## Usage

To use the provided code and scripts:

1. **factors.c**
   - Compile the C code using a C compiler, such as GCC.
   - Execute the compiled binary, providing necessary inputs.

     Example:
     ```bash
     gcc factors.c -o factors
     ./factors
     ```

2. **rsa**
   - Execute the RSA-related script or binary, providing necessary inputs.

     Example:
     ```bash
     ./rsa [options] [arguments]
     ```

3. **test1**
   - Use the test file or example to understand how the RSA factoring challenge is approached.

4. **wfactors.py**
   - Run the Python script, providing necessary inputs.

     Example:
     ```bash
     python wfactors.py
     ```
